This can be achieved by performing the watershed on the distance transformation of the boundary prediction. Similar concepts have been used for a long time to deal with missing edge information in other applications (for example in here). Performing the watershed on the distance transformation ensures that all gaps smaller than the object diameter are closed by the superpixels. In practice this is almost always the case, therefore high quality segmentations can be obtained even for a low number of superpixels.
